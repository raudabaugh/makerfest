"question": "What is a Maker Fest, anyway? What are you making?",
"answer":"We are leaving this very open ended. It could be anything from hobby electronics to 3D printing to arts and crafts. See <a href='http://www.instructables.com'>Instructables.com</a> for some good examples. Basically, we want you to show us anything cool you have made in your free time. Because it's International Pi Day, expect to see a lot of <a href='http://www.raspberrypi.org'>Raspberry Pi</a> projects, though <a href='http://www.arduino.cc'>Arduino</a> and <a href='http://beagleboard.org'>BeagleBone</a> are certainly welcome too!"
