<p>We are leaving this very open ended. It could be anything from hobby electronics to 3D printing to arts and crafts. See <a href='http://www.instructables.com'>Instructables.com</a> for some good examples. Basically, we want you to show us anything cool you have made in your free time. Because it's International Pi Day, expect to see a lot of <a href='http://www.raspberrypi.org'>Raspberry Pi</a> projects, though <a href='http://www.arduino.cc'>Arduino</a> and <a href='http://beagleboard.org'>BeagleBone</a> are certainly welcome too!

To quote [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture)

<blockquote>
	<p>
 Typical interests enjoyed by the maker culture include engineering-oriented pursuits such as electronics, robotics, 3-D printing, and the use of CNC tools, as well as more traditional activities such as metalworking, woodworking, and traditional arts and crafts. The subculture stresses a cut-and-paste approach to standardized hobbyist technologies, and encourages cookbook re-use of designs published on websites and maker-oriented publications. Learning emphasizes learning-through-doing (constructivism) in a social environment. Maker culture emphasizes informal, networked, peer-led, and shared learning motivated by fun and self-fulfillment.</p>
